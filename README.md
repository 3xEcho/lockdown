# Lockdown Arch
Lockdown Arch is a simple home lab designed with common operational standards to support the most critical missions with no extra layers or features.Its composable to support additional features or services without affecting the core services.

This environment adheres to principles of interoperability and hopefully, when time exists, will utilize NAFv4. Seamless communication and efficient operation even in offline scenarios.

Lockdown Arch focuses on capability-based planning to ensure your lab remains resilient, secure, and mission-ready.
